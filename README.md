# 317_Mobile-Money-Awareness-Adoption-Use

This repository includes Stata .do files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the analysis of factors associated with mobile money awareness, adoption, and use, using data from Intermedia's Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) surveys. These files were developed as part of the EPAR "Digital Financial Services & Gender: An Analysis of Correlates of Awareness, Adoption, and Use" project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/digital-financial-services-gender-analysis-correlates-awareness-adoption

We use data for the first three waves of the FII survey: 2013/14, 2014, and 2015. Data for these waves are available for Bangladesh, India, Indonesia (2014 and 2015 only), Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda.

We include separate .do files which prepare the data for each country and wave for analysis, starting from the raw data. The raw data can be requested from Intermedia by clicking "contact InterMedia" at the following website: http://finclusion.org/data_fiinder/

We also include one .do file which conducts cross-wave and cross-country regression analyses of mobile money outcome variables, and one .do file which produces weighted descriptive statistics for selected indicates using Wave 3 (2015) data. These analyses replicate what is included in EPAR Technical Report #317.

The .do files include notes on how to run the files, including accessing the raw data and updating the global macros to specify the locations where files will be saved. After making these changes, the .do files can be run in their entirety to replicate our analyses, or modified to conduct new analyses. To access the .do files, either clone this repository or click on the green "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download zip".
