*Data source
*-----------
*The Financial Inclusion Insights Wave 3 data was collected by Intermedia 
*The data were collected over the period of June 2015 â€“ October 2015.
*All the raw data, questionnaires, and basic information documents can be requested from Intermedia by clicking "contact InterMedia" at the following link
*http://finclusion.org/data_fiinder/


*Summary of Executing the Master do.file
*-----------
*This Master do.file constructs selected sociodemogaphic and mobile money uptake outcome variables from the Uganda Financial Inclusion Insights Wave 2 data set.
*After downloading the "FSP_Final_Uganda_W3 (public).xlsx" data file from Intermedia, we convert it to Stata .dta format for analysis. 
*The do.file first creates sociodemogaphic variables and then outcome variables related to mobile money uptake.
*We then save a clean .dta file at the end, which we merge with other .dta files from other FII countries and waves for analysis in a separate .do file.
